This is simple linear regression implementation, using python sci kit learn


you may ask, how is linear regression done? 
it is done following the linear regression equation, unlike most computations, it doesn't follow a recursive algorithm
it is a straight away calculation!

it makes the best fit line through the data points you provide, aka, it draws a line with the least squared error possible!
